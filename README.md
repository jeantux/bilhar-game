# Bilhar game developed with javascript
This game is the result of a series of studies that I started in games with this wonderful language.

It is inevitable to create this game without understanding fantastic concepts, such as collision and behavior of objects, code organization,
abstracting a layer it is possible to understand mathematical calculations in a fun way and going a little deeper, understand a little about
team work.

And of course, not to mention that our game is animal, I particularly lost some time playing.
